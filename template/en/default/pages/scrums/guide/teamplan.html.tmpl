><H3>Steps of planning</H3>
<p>
Any individual item weather it is bug or other item, can be in different states depending on plans, that team has.
Item can be, in Scrums point of view, in unplanned state, in backlog, in sprint plan or elapsed. 
Every item is forced into predefined path through different stages. This has purpose of enforcing product and team management.
Control of work flow is gained by dividing tasks into separate roles.<br>

</p
<p>
Backlog for team is simple list of items, where items are in defined order.
Unplanned items are taken into backlog, whence they become planned<sup>1</sup>. Items in backlog can be sorted. 
Order of items is meant to represent relative priority of items.
</p
><p>
Items in backlog are taken into sprint, whence they become scheduled<sup>2</sup>. Each sprint has defined time schedule and
also items inside individual sprint can be ordered. 
</p
><p>
After sprint has ended it is archived<sup>3</sup>. 
It is notable, that item, which remains open, while sprint is archived, becomes unplanned once more.
</p
><H3>Team product back-log planning</H3
><P>
Team is assigned components, whence all tasks and but related to assigned components are fixed to team.
Set of components, that team is responsible, form virtual product, team product.
View for back-log planning consists of two lists of items. 'Unordered bugs'-list contains any open item, that belongs to team, but which
has not been taken into other lists. 'Backlog'-list contains items, that are in team product backlog, but which are not
scheduled in sprint. Taking items into backlog is managing product. Product means in here those components, that the team
in question has responsibility. Product backlog is common to any responsibilities, that team might have.
</P
><P>
Items are taken into backlog by dragging lines from one list to another. Order of items in backlog is saved. 
On the other hand order of items in unordered bugs-list is not saved. Items can be also moved in opposite direction
from backlog to unordered bugs. Order of items is changed by sorting with mouse. Item is selected with mouse and dragged into new position in list or other list. In the end item is dropped into new place by releasing.
</P
><H3>Sprint planning</H3
><P>
View consists of two lists of items. Sprint list contains all items in sprint. Shown sprint is currently active sprint, that
team has, since team can have only one active sprint simultaneously.
'Backlog'-list contains items, that are in product backlog, but which are not
scheduled in sprint. Items are in only one active list simultaneously.
</P
><P>
It is possible to edit sprint information. From sprint editing it is also possible to move sprint into archived state.
Archiving means ending sprint once and for all. Sprint is meant to last limited time. This is also enforced by allowing
only one active sprint simultaneously. While ending and archiving sprint end date must be given.
</P
><P>
Items are taken into sprint by dragging lines from one list to another. Order of items in sprint is also saved and
items can be sorted. 
Items can be also moved in opposite direction from sprint to backlog. 
Order of items is changed by sorting with mouse. Item is selected with mouse and dragged into new position in list or other list. In the end item is dropped into new place by releasing.
</P
><H3>Sprint burn-down chart</H3
><P>
Burn-down chart shows progress of sprint. Primary quantity, that is measured in burn-down chart is
<i>time remaining</i>. It is shown, so that it would be possible to make predictions about sprint into future.
Also the amount of total work in sprint can be shown. This feature is optional and it makes sense only when work hours have been recorded
into system during the sprint.
</P
><P>
Status summary pie charts and tables show number of open and closed items in sprint. Second pie chart shows more detailed, what status items
in sprint have.
</P
><H3>Archived sprints</H3
><P>
Archived sprints-view shows ended sprints of team. Sprints are shown in time order. Newest sprint is shown first.
</P>
